After 10 years, HackMySQL.com was retired in 2015. The tools are archived here, but do not use them. Instead, check out:

* [Percona Toolkit](https://www.percona.com/software/mysql-tools/percona-toolkit)
* [Percona Monitoring & Management](https://www.percona.com/software/database-tools/percona-monitoring-and-management)
* [Orchestrator](https://github.com/github/orchestrator)
* [gh-ost](https://github.com/github/gh-ost)
